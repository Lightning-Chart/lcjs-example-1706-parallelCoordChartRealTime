This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

Example of real-time parallel coordinate chart use case.

Also showcases:

-   Data cleaning (remove older data points than 1 minute)
-   Dynamic coloring of feature that is not part of visible axes
-   Updating dynamic coloring during run-time

The idea behind the example is to display historical multivariate trends and highlight which values are new and which old using coloring.
Bright colors are new, whereas dimmer transparent colors old.
